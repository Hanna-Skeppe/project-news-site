# News Site

The weekly, individual project, @ Technigo Bootcamp, week 2. The task was to create a one-page news site using Html and CSS. The topic oc the news site could be anything that you choose. The focus of this project was on using semantic Html-tags and to learn the box-model and flexbox, and to make a responsive site (mobile-first).

## The problem

I approached the task by first choosing the topic (Slow Living) and then I did a sketch/ outline of the page (on paper. I decided how the header would look like, how the "big-news-section" would look like, and then the "newscards" and footer.

Then I spent some time gathering material for my site. Finding articles, , pictures, a logo and deciding on the fonts and color-scheme.

My coding-approach was to first write the Html for the header and then go on and write the CSS for that section and so on, section by section.

I decided early on that I would focus on flexbox, and if I had time left, I would have a go att trying to make a CSS grid for the newscards. 

When I did the styling of the newscard I tried to do them in a way I had not intended at first, because I got inspired by newscards I found o different sites. For example I tried to do a card that was 50% picture on top and then 50% text under, and other layouts. I struggeled with that for awhile, but gave up when I din't really know how to do it the way I wanted. I also struggeled a bit with getting the pictures and text to fit in the cards the right way, and the cards having the same size and being aligned. I tried a lot of different combinations using dimensions with pixels and percent, together witch different flexbox properties, and margin/padding.

I also wanted to add a "category-button" on each card using position relative/absolute, and struggeled with that also until I solved it by putting classes on the cards, which I hadn't done previously. I understood that I had to use classes, because otherwise the span-tag with position relative would not know what element to relate itself to, since all of the cards had position relative. So I was pleased when I solved that finlly.

I also used position relative/absolute on the "big news section", to get the text on top of the image on smaller screens and I was very happy with how that turned out.

I used a hover-effect on the links in the header, wich turned out nice. I also used a hover-effect (on bigger screens) for the cards using transform/transition. I also added box-shadows on header, cards and footer.

Overall I am very happy with how my news site turned out in the end. Considering I had a limited amount of time, and there was a lot of new information to process I am pleased with the outcome.


If I had more time, I would have a go at using grid layout for the newscards. I would also want to make different kinds of newscards with different layouts for a more intresting overall impression, and also of course to learn more.
I would also make the hamburger-icon work, so that when clicked on the links would appear, from the top.
I would also do some more work on the subscribe-form in the footer.
